# SCP-SL-Google-Translate-Mod
This is a "mod" for SCP: Secret Laboratory. *ALMOST* all TXT files within the translation folder was changed. Please read the INSTRUCTIONS file in order to understand what to do.


This took quite some time and its not 100% perfect, I left some things out but the good majority of stuff has been translated. Some were half translated and the rest were left around because I just couldnt be bothered lol (I will change them later on)

I will be updating this for bug fixing and I will update them when 12.0 comes out and any other future updates. And thats if there will be extra text I would need to tinker with.

Hopefully people will use this just to get a good laugh! I have to say there are a lot of interesting translations...

Oh and please, if there are any broken text please tell me, Toast_#4186!


VER 1.1.0
