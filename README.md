# SCP-SL-Google-Translate-Mod
This is a "mod" for SCP: Secret Laboratory. *ALMOST* all TXT files within the translation folder was changed. Please read the INSTRUCTIONS file in order to understand how to use the file. Read the README file for extra info!


This took quite some time and its not 100% perfect, I left some things out but the good majority of stuff has been translated. Some were half translated and the rest were left around because I just couldnt be bothered lol

I will be updating this and I will update them when 12.0 comes out and any other future updates. And thats if there will be extra text I would need to tinker with.

Hopefully people will use this just to get a good laugh! I have to say there are a lot of interesting translations...

Oh and please, if there are any broken text please tell me, Toast_#4186!


VER 1.0.0
